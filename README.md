Discover the countries around the world you were never taught about in school! The world is a big place, with lots of different countries. However, the majority of us are taught only about those countries that are considered ‘important’. This can often leave us feeling uneducated and ignorant, especially when we hear other people talking about places that we have never heard of before. But there are so many countries in the world, and so much to learn about them! This can be a real barrier for anyone who wants to know more about the world but is scared of feeling stupid.
